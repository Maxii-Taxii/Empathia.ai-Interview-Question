Subject: Consultation Report for Michael

Dear Dr. [Referring Doctor's Name],

Thank you for referring Michael for a Cardiology consultation. He was examined on 2023/05/15.

Michael, a 45-year-old male, presented with a chief complaint of chest pain and shortness of breath. He has been experiencing these symptoms for the past two weeks, especially after physical exertion. The patient has a history of hypertension, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2018, and suffered a mild heart attack in 2020. Post-heart attack, he underwent angioplasty. His father had a history of heart disease and passed away from a heart attack at age 60. Michael is a software engineer who works from home, lives with his wife and two children, smokes a pack of cigarettes per day, and occasionally drinks alcohol. His current medications include Metformin, Lisinopril, and Aspirin. Michael is allergic to penicillin.

Upon examination, mild wheezing was heard in the lungs, with no edema in the lower extremities recorded in the notes. Vital signs showed a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg, heart rate of 85 bpm. Investigations indicated a previous myocardial infarction on ECG and elevated cholesterol levels.

The assessment suggests a likely diagnosis of Angina pectoris and Coronary artery disease, considering his symptoms and medical history. The treatment plan includes scheduling a stress test to evaluate the heart's function during physical activity, adjusting hypertension medication to better control blood pressure, recommending a smoking cessation program, and a follow-up appointment in one month to review test results and adjust the treatment plan as necessary.
