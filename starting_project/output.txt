Subject: Consultation Report for Jane

Dear Dr. [Referring Doctor's Name],

Thank you for referring Jane for an Obstetrics & Gynecology consultation. She was examined on 2022/01/01.

Jane, female, presented with a chief complaint of OB consultation for pregnancy management with planned repeat cesarean section. Jane had COVID-19 in 2021, post-infection she experienced heart pain but was evaluated and found to be in good health. She is not currently on any medications. Jane is allergic to minocycline. She is employed part-time as a banker and has a support network of local friends, with additional postpartum support planned from her mother and a babysitter. Obstetrically, Jane is pregnant with her third child, with one previous live birth via cesarean section and one abortion due to fetal health issues.

There were no examination, vital signs, physical examination findings, or investigations recorded in the notes.

The assessment suggests a likely diagnosis of previous cesarean section (654.21), considering her symptoms and medical history. The treatment plan includes a scheduled repeat cesarean section at 39 weeks gestation, instructions to present to City Medical Center if labor begins prior, advice to walk daily for improved blood pressure and baby's health, and scheduled follow-up appointments leading up to the delivery date.

If you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to contact me at drjohndoe@clinic.com.

Sincerely,
Dr. John Doe
